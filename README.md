<br/>
This was an app challenge that I thaught to take part in by Hitesh Chaudhary founder of Learn Code Online.
<br/>

<h4>LEVEL 1. Beginner</h4>

I love workout. I want you to design an app that can help me workout.

As soon as I open the app, It selects 5 exercise for me in the background. Then it asks me number of sets that I want to do. Number for set will remain same for all exercise.

Every exercise will have different duration.
For ex: 
<ul>
<li>pushpus - 5 mins</li>
<li>crunches: 4 mins</li>
<li>plank: 40 seconds</li>
</ul>


Break duration is fixed: 40 seconds

I should be able to see, all exercise that app has selected for me. Once I hit start workout button. App will play music for the duration of exercise. To indicate that there is a break, music will stop and will resume as soon as break is over.



<h4>LEVEL 2. Moderate</h4> 
Assuming you have read above instructions carefully, here are additional features.
a. Add a random button, which can again select different exercise.
b. Different music for every exercise.

<h4>Level 3 Advance.</h4>
With all the above features. App will be working in 2 modes. Random mode and daywise mode. As soon as I open the app, it will ask me to select the mode.

In day wise mode, Based on the day, 5 exercises are given to the user and user cannot change it.

NOTE:
1. I love card based UI.
2. Use our logo and assets
